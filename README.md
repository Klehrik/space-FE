A tactics game in space (the FE stands for Fire Emblem).  
Dropped due to the combat system being way too convoluted to follow (I have since forgotten how it works).

Used music and sound effects from FTL: Faster Than Light as placeholder, which have been replaced with empty sound files on uploading here for copyright reasons.  
The font used is from [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php).
