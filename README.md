A tactics game in space (the FE stands for Fire Emblem).  
Dropped due to the combat system being way too convoluted to follow; essentially, each weapon depletes a certain amount of Hull, Shield, and Energy. If a ship still has energy, it will dodge the attack entirely (except for Lasers I think), otherwise it will take Shield damage first, and then Hull damage if Shields are down. Moving ships around also depletes Energy. You can also target specific systems to make them less functional (this never got to be implemented).
